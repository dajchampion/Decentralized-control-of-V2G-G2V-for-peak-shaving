# Decentralized-control-of-V2G-G2V-for-peak-shaving
This method is developed in a decentralized control structure. 
It considers the real-time load fluctuation. 
It optimizes EVs that arrive at the parking lot at the same time as a group. 
Then, update the baseload.
However, when the number of EVs in the city increases, or when a special event causes a large number of EVs to be plugged in at the same time, it will take time to optimize EV charging and discharging.
